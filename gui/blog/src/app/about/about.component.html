            Blogs evolved from online diaries and journals in the mid-90s. <br>
            At that time, internet users were already running personal web pages where they published regular updates
            about their personal lives, thoughts, and social
            commentary. <br>
            The term web log was first used during the late 90s, which later became ‘weblog’, then ‘we blog’, and
            finally just ‘blog’. <br>

            Due to the growing number of such web pages, several tools started to appear, which made it easier for users
            to create online journals and personal blogs. These tools helped popularize blogging and made the technology
            accessible to non-technical users.<br>

            Blogs are a type of website. The only real difference between a blog and other types of website is that
            blogs are updated on a regular basis with new content, which is displayed in reverse chronological order
            (new blog
            posts first).<br>

            Typical websites are static in nature where content is organized in pages, and they are not updated
            frequently.
            Whereas a blog is dynamic, and it is usually updated more frequently. Some bloggers publish multiple new
            articles a day.<br>

            Blogs can be part of a larger website. Often businesses have a blog section where they regularly create
            content to inform and educate their customers.<br>
